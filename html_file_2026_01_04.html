```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Motivational Quote</title>
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;
            background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #00c6ff, #0072ff);
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
        }

        .quote {
            font-size: 2em;
            max-width: 600px;
            background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 10px;
            box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
        }

        .author {
            margin-top: 20px;
            font-size: 1.5em;
            font-style: italic;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="quote">
        "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
        <div class="author">- Steve Jobs</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The document is structured using standard HTML5 elements.
   - There is a `<div>` with the class `quote` that contains the motivational quote and the author's name.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - The `body` is styled to cover the full viewport height and is centered using Flexbox. A gradient background is applied.
   - The `.quote` class has a semi-transparent black background, padding, and rounded corners for aesthetics.
   - The text color is set to white for clarity against the background.

Feel free to modify the quote or styles as you wish!
